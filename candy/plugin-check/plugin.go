// Package check is the charly plugin OWNING the externalized `charly check` command family (P12):
// the box/live/run/feature evaluation surface + the AI-iteration harness / R10 bed-runner. The
// plugin owns the CLI grammar, the plan gathering, and the output formatting; the composite
// host-serving Mechanisms it cannot perform in a separate module — building the venue executor,
// extracting the OCI-label plan, and dispatching the plan-walk's verbs through the provider
// registry — stay in core and are reached via the remaining HostBuild seams
// (cli / check-load-plugins / check-bed-gpu-prereq) + the plugin's own
// loaderkit reads (the former generic "check-run" HostBuild seam is DELETED, K-wave 2 cone R4 —
// every check-run mode now dispatches to this plugin's OWN bodies; the post-run prune's
// retention-defaults resolve moved plugin-side, K-wave 2 cone R6), the config loader +
// deploy ledger via the plugin-side loader readers (check is read-only — no ledger writes), the agent CLI via
// InvokeProvider(kind:agent), and the `charly` reentry (the harness shells out to build/deploy/
// check subcommands) via HostBuild("cli"). No plugin-specific command LOGIC is left in core.
//
// check is COMPILED-IN (charly.yml compiled_plugins): its Invoke(OpRun) runs in charly's process
// and gets the in-proc reverse channel (dispatchInProcCommand threads it), so the check-run /
// config / cli / agent host seams reach the core engine. The out-of-process CliMain path has no
// reverse channel and so errors — check cannot run out-of-process (it needs the host seams). The
// SAME NewProvider()/NewMeta() compile INTO charly in-process — placement is invisible.
