// TestRunner_VmTargetName proves the host-side check verbs address a VM deployment by its per-deploy
// DOMAIN IDENTITY (the live libvirt domain charly-<domainID>), NOT the shared kind:vm entity. The
// go-libvirt shed moved ResolveVmTarget out-of-process (it can no longer LoadUnified to compute the
// domain), so the host threads the already-resolved domain identity to the spice/libvirt verbs via
// kit.Runner.VmTargetName(); without this the operator-side probes looked up the wrong name and failed
// "domain not found". Post-P33 the domain is named after the DEPLOY, so the check runner sets VmName to
// the domain identity (spec.VmDomainIdentity of the bed/deploy key), not the entity.
