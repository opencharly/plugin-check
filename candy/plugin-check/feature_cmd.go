// runs a running deployment's OWN baked plan as acceptance tests: deterministic check: steps run
// their probes and prose-only agent-check: steps bind to the agent grader (unless --no-agent). All
// the gathering AND the agent-grader wiring run PLUGIN-side (hostCheckRun's Mode:"feature-live",
// which threads Tag/Agent/Timeout/Strict/NoAgent); the plugin sends the CLI
// inputs, prints the built Header banner, and formats the returned []StepResult.
//
// The build-scope `charly box feature run <image>` leaf stays under the `box` command tree in core
// (it feeds the same host engine over a feature-box seam mode) — this file owns ONLY the
// check-side, deploy-scope `charly check feature run` leaf.

// CheckFeatureCmd groups `charly check feature run` under the live-check hierarchy.
