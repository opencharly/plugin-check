// #75 — bed-scoped fixture image tags (relocated from charly/bed_run_image_tag_test.go, #55 W3
// B2-full). This unit test pins the pure formula; the kubernetes-preresolver node.Version honoring + the
// plugin's per-step --tag threading are integration-proven by the concurrent check-sidecar-pod +
// check-k8s-deploy bed run (the R10 gate).

// TestBedRunImageTag proves the per-RUN bed-scoped tag is <bed>-<calver> and that
// distinct beds/runs yield distinct tags (the collision-free-by-construction
// property). Would FAIL if the formula regressed to a shared/constant tag.
