// bed_diagnostics.go — the R10 "a warning is not a pass" gate over the retained step logs.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. bed_run.go's step() recorded ONLY the child's exit code. That is not
// sufficient: pacman treats a refused install scriptlet / post-transaction hook as
// NON-fatal, so a `charly box build` whose log carried 33 `warning:` lines and 56
// `error:` lines still exited 0 and summary.yml reported `image-build ok: true`. Fifty-one
// unexecuted scriptlets shipped in every CachyOS image that way, unnoticed, until a human
// grepped the logs by hand. CLAUDE.md R10 requires zero warnings — but nothing measured it,
// and a rule nothing measures is a rule that silently regresses.
//
// WHAT IT DOES. Every step log written by step() is scanned once, line by line, by the
// anchored pattern table below. Findings are partitioned by SEVERITY and by whether an
// explicit allowlist entry claims them, and the counts + the distinct shapes + the
// allowlist verdicts are written into summary.yml so a reader can audit the verdict
// without re-grepping the logs.
//
// THE DISPOSITION, and why the two tiers differ. The split is not a taste call — it was
// MEASURED before it was chosen. Scanning the newest retained run of all 61 beds in the
// reference tree, counting only steps that PASSED on exit code:
//
//	error tier   → 48 beds clean, 13 dirty. Every one of the 13 is a genuine swallowed
//	               failure: pacman's refused scriptlets (the RCA case, 3 pod beds), mkinitcpio's
//	               `==> ERROR: failed to detect root filesystem` (3 VM beds), grub-probe on an
//	               overlay root, and charly's OWN `charly: error: starting VM …: domain is
//	               already running` printed and then continued past (7 VM beds).
//	warning tier → ~18 beds dirty, and — decisively — several of them are beds the error tier
//	               leaves GREEN (check-ubuntu-coder-pod at 27 warnings and 0 errors;
//	               check-k8s-deploy, check-migrate-local, check-exampledeploy at 1 each).
//
// So:
//
//	severityError   → FATAL from this first iteration. It has real teeth (13 beds red, the RCA
//	                  case among them) without reding the roster (48 stay green), and every red
//	                  is a defect CLAUDE.md R1/R2 already require fixing. The error allowlist holds
//	                  exactly ONE entry, and it is CONDITIONAL — see diagnosticAllowlist below for
//	                  why the premise that kept it empty turned out to have a counter-example, and
//	                  why a conditional exemption does not weaken the tier.
//	severityWarning → counted and reported, NOT fatal yet. Promoting it today would red beds
//	                  that are otherwise perfectly green, on two enumerable upstream/config
//	                  classes — pacman's `<pkg> is up to date -- skipping` and the
//	                  `could not isolate the network` sandbox residue whose ROOT CAUSE is the
//	                  same defect the error tier now catches. That is a bounded, named
//	                  promotion condition, not an open-ended "someday" (CLAUDE.md R2: the
//	                  non-blocking find joins the next thematic batch, planned and begun now).
//
// What keeps the warning stage from being a permanent weakening: the tier is ONE field —
// diagnosticPolicy.WarningsFatal — and the matcher, the allowlist, the per-shape report and
// the failure path are ALREADY wired through it, so promotion is a flag flip plus allowlist
// curation, never a new feature. TestPromotedWarningTierGoesRed proves the flip turns a real
// captured log red, and TestWarningTierIsReportedEvenWhenNotFatal proves the count is never
// silently dropped in the meantime.
//
// WHY ANCHORED PATTERNS, NOT A SUBSTRING SCAN. A build log's final stage carries the baked
// `ai.opencharly.description` LABEL — one enormous line of candy prose and plan JSON that
// contains the literal words "error" and "stderr" many times over. Check output likewise
// carries step descriptions such as "check invoking relay-wrapper with no port argument
// prints a usage error". A `grep -i error` gate would fire on all of it and be switched off
// within a day. Every pattern below is therefore anchored at line start (after a bounded,
// enumerated emitter prefix), which excludes those shapes structurally — no length cutoff,
